In the last 50 days, Raycast released their [iOS app](https://www.raycast.com/ios), rolled out the much-awaited
[Windows Beta](https://x.com/thomaspaulmann/status/1937887427852488719) and got sherlocked ([or not?](https://x.com/thomaspaulmann/status/1932406174344757379)) by Apple, when they announced a
revolutionary update to the macOS Spotlight.

Raycast hype is at its peak and a lot of fresh eyes are on the product. A year ago I
wrote [Raycast: Second Impressions](https://www.lukeberrypi.com/articles/raycast-second-impressions), narrating my switch from Alfred to Raycast.

Since then I've spent hundreds of hours understanding how it works and extracting
the most of it. It's time to write about it again.

I will explain Everything I with in Raycast, down to the nuts and bolts of
it. Let's do this!

that is a valid question

I see raycast as a layer that sits on top of everything I do on my computer

it makes all of the above > 20% better in terms of UX and speed

may be negligeable, but spread across the board it has changed my workflow completely

also it's free, so I'd rather use it instead of individual app alternatives (e.g, spotlight for app launch, rectangle for window management, maccy for clipboard history, etc...)

i just do it all inside raycast with better defaults and easier customization
